Source code for the Shiny climate partitioning app, climpart.

The purpose of this app is to aid seed selection efforts of restoration and revegetation practitioners by matching the climate of georeferenced seed sources to potential target sites. Analyses are conducted on the Bioclim (http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim) dataset for the extent of North America (-168 to -52 degrees longitude and 7 to 83 degrees latitude). We chose to incorporate seven of these variables that together capture unique axes of multivariate climate space, including: mean annual temperature, diurnal range, temperature seasonality, temperature of warmest quarter, mean annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of warmest quarter. Climate match is assessed based upon a climate similarity index derived from these Bioclim variables. To operate the app, the user may input a lat/long bounding box with the supplied slider bars or a spatial polygon for their extent of interest. They then upload a spreadsheet in .csv file format containing three columns: accession id, decimal degrees longitude, and decimal degrees latitude. The user then clicks the “Match Seed to Climate” button, and the app maps the closest climate match of supplied accessions across the area of interest. By clicking a point on the map, a popup appears with coordinates and climate match rankings for all uploaded accessions. Also reported are the corresponding Bioclim data for each of the accessions, as well as the distributions of their assignments. The user can then download and explore the underlying rasters, climate data of accessions, and assignment distributions for offline use.
